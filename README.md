## Projects and Features

### 1. **Price Calculator**
   - A utility to calculate the total price of items based on their quantity and individual prices.
   - Demonstrates Go's capability for handling business logic efficiently.
   - Uses functions, loops, and basic input/output techniques.

### 2. **Notepad App**
   - A console-based application to create `.txt` files with user-defined content.
   - Highlights Go's file operations and interaction with the file system.
   - Includes a feature to keep the app open for user interaction before it exits.

### 3. **Structs and Methods**
   - Examples of defining custom types and attaching methods to them.
   - Implements Go's object-oriented-like behavior without traditional inheritance.

### 4. **Interfaces**
   - Showcases Go's abstraction capabilities.
   - Demonstrates the power of interfaces for writing reusable and flexible code.

### 5. **Generics**
   - Examples of using generics for type-safe and reusable programming constructs.

### 6. **Closures**
   - Illustrates the concept of closures by capturing variables in their enclosing scopes.

### 7. **Variadic Functions**
   - Demonstrates handling functions with a variable number of arguments.

### 8. **JSON Encoding and Decoding**
   - Practical examples of working with JSON data.
   - Explores encoding, decoding, and custom configurations for JSON operations.

### 9. **Goroutines**
   - Concurrency handling in Go using goroutines.
   - Examples of synchronizing concurrent operations with channels and `WaitGroup`.

### 10. **Collections in Go**
   - Practical usage of slices, arrays, and maps with real-world examples.
   - Highlights Go's memory efficiency and collection management.
